The goal for this project was for our team to create a simple, smart IoT door lock. We were able to accomplish this with the use of photoresistors which would act as a combination to unlock the door.  More importantly, we wanted the photoresistor pattern to change each time the user wanted access to the building, and lastly, for the user to get informed of this new password via email. We used AWS IoT to obtain this goal.
